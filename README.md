# SemicolonFixer
Simple low-level C++ program to rebind key on broken keyboard for Windows

Just compile and run the .exe, then minimize. Program will be listening.

The other day I've been cleaning my keyboard in my laptop and for some reason the semicolon key - the most critical in coding - stopped responding. To keep having fun with my hobby, I decided to sacrifice another key and rebind semicolon to it.

So there it is - program rebinding my semicolon, coded using Copy&Paste semicolons.
Maybe some day this code will save someone's time.
